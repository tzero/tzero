## Here's a long section title with punctuation! Right?

What about lists, though?

- Here's nesting level 1.
   - Here's _nesting level_ 2.
      - Here's nesting level 3.
   - Back to nesting ***level*** 2.
   - Another one.
   - How about some `code`? Or a [link](#)?
   - How about a line  
      break?
- Back to nesting level 1. If I do a carriage return here,
    will it recognize this as part of the same line?
- What if I do a carriage return and then neglect to indent
the text on the next line?

More text.

1. **I**
2. *don't*
3. ~~know~~

## Another long section name, just to see what that looks like: the movie.

### A subsection.

 1. something
 1. _something_ else
 1. more **_things_**
    +  nested
    +  items
       1. Another one
